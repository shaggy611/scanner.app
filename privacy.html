                you install and/or use software application for mobile devices (the “App”, “our App”) and explains how
                we and some of the companies we cooperate while processing that information.
                When we refer to personal data (or personal information) we mean any information of any kind relating to
                a natural person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to such data.
                It is a natural person who can be identified directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an

                economic, cultural or social status.
                Our Privacy policy applies to all users, and others who access the App (“Users”).
                For the purposes of the GDPR, we are the data controller, unless otherwise stated.

                When you use the App, some information about your device and your user behaviour may be processed

                association with any specific individual, and we may access it only in aggregated form. We process this
                information on the ground of our legitimate interest in improving our App and giving our users the best

                We use third-party automatic data processing technologies to analyze certain information sent by your
                device or our App. Automatic data processing technologies (advertising or analytics tools) provide us

                your personal data, that might be collected by their own means (not through our App). Due to the fact
                that some of our third parties declare themselves controllers for the purposes of the GDPR, any
                information request regarding your personal data should be directed to such third parties.

                country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as in your jurisdiction.
                This means that your personal information can be transferred to a third country, a territory or one or
                more specified sectors within that third country, or to the international organization where data
                protection and confidentiality regulations may not provide the same level of protection of personal data
